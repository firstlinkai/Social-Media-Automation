Automate Your Social Media in One Click – Across All Platforms

Managing content across multiple platforms can be time-consuming, especially for small businesses and content creators. That’s why I've built a smart automation system using the no-code platform Make, Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google Sheets—and it’s a game-changer. 

Here’s how it works 👇

1️⃣ Source Trending Topics
→ A Google Sheet stores the latest article/blog/news URLs.

2️⃣ Summarize with AI
→ Perplexity AI reads the article and creates a high-quality summary.

3️⃣ Visuals & Content Generation
→ ChatGPT uses the summary to:

- Create a platform-specific image via DALL·E

- Write an Instagram caption, Facebook post, Medium blog, LinkedIn update, and more

4️⃣ Smart Distribution
→ A Router node distributes the tailored content and images across platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Medium, Pinterest, Tumblr, X, and more.

✅ One input. Multiple platforms. Fully customized content.
✅ Perfect for businesses that want to stay consistent without the daily grind of content creation.
